            "content": "UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has urged Donald Trump not to walk away from an international deal designed to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.\nSpeaking to the BBC, Mr Guterres said there was a real risk of war if the 2015 agreement was not preserved.\nMr Trump has been a strong critic of the accord, in which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions.\nThe US president has until 12 May to decide whether to stick with the deal. \nMr Guterres told the BBC that the Iran agreement was an \"important diplomatic victory\" and should be maintained.\n\"We should not scrap it unless we have a good alternative,\" he said, adding: \"We face dangerous times.\"\nIt comes just days after Israel revealed \"secret nuclear files\" accusing Iran of having covertly pursued nuclear weapons.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the files provided proof that the Obama-era nuclear deal was \"built on lies\".\nEuropean allies France, the UK and Germany meanwhile have agreed that pursuing the current nuclear deal with Iran is the best way to stop it developing nuclear weapons.\nIn 2015 Tehran signed a deal with the US, China, Russia, Germany, France and Britain agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions.\nUnder the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran is committed to slashing the number of its centrifuges, which are machines used to enrich uranium.\nIt is also meant to cut its stockpile of enriched uranium drastically and not enrich remaining uranium to the level needed to produce nuclear weapons.\nThe number of centrifuges installed at Iran's Natanz and Fordo sites was cut drastically soon after the deal while tonnes of low-enriched uranium were shipped to Russia.\nFurthermore, monitors from the IAEA have been able to carry out snap inspections at Iranian nuclear sites.\nOn Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu revealed what he said were pages of material that proved Iran had covertly pursued nuclear weapons. \nSpeaking in English from Israel's defence ministry in Tel Aviv, Mr Netanyahu showed off what he said were \"exact copies\" of documents obtained by Israeli intelligence from a secret storage facility in Tehran.\nThere were, he said, 55,000 pages of evidence and a further 55,000 files on 183 CDs relating to a secret nuclear weapons programme, dubbed Project Amad.\nThe project, he said, had had the explicit goal of producing five warheads, each with the yield of 10 kilotonnes of TNT.\nHe said Tehran had continued to pursue what he described as nuclear weapons knowledge after the project was shuttered in 2003.\nHe said this was evidence that Iran had lied about its nuclear ambitions before the deal was signed in 2015.\nTension between the long-standing enemies has grown steadily since Iran built up its military presence in Syria, which lies to the north-east of Israel.\nMr Trump has frequently voiced his opposition to the \"insane\" deal, which he has described as the \"worst ever\". \nHe has warned that the US would withdraw completely on 12 May - the next deadline for waiving sanctions - unless European signatories to the deal and Congress addressed his concerns.\nHe is unhappy that the deal only limited Iran's nuclear activities for a fixed period and had failed to stop the development of ballistic missiles.\nHe also said it had handed Iran a $100bn (£72bn) windfall that it used \"as a slush fund for weapons, terror, and oppression\" across the Middle East.\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani has questioned the legitimacy of efforts by the US and France to change the nuclear deal with his country.\nMr Rouhani has said that Mr Trump has no \"right\" to renegotiate the seven-party agreement.\nHe has said Iran \"will not accept any restrictions beyond its commitments\" to comply with international rules in the years ahead.\nMr Rouhani has also accused Mr Trump of \"maliciously violating\" the nuclear agreement.\nIran maintains that the missiles it has tested are not designed to carry nuclear warheads and insists its nuclear programme is a peaceful one for energy purposes.\n",

            "content": "French President Emmanuel Macron has used his speech to the joint houses of the US Congress to denounce nationalism and isolationism.\nMr Macron said such policies were a threat to global prosperity.\nThe speech was widely interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on President Donald Trump's America First agenda.\nMr Macron also raised differences on global trade, Iran and the environment, seemingly in contrast to the warm bonhomie of his visit so far.\nThe French president was given a three-minute standing ovation as he took his place in the chamber for his speech.\nHe hailed the \"unbreakable bonds\" of the US and France, forged in \"liberty, tolerance and equal rights\".\nHe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, and is in Washington as the first foreign leader to be afforded a US state visit by the Trump White House.\nBut the French president's comments showed that the pair do not agree on all subjects.\nMr Macron said isolationism, withdrawal and nationalism \"can be tempting to us as a temporary remedy to our fears. But closing the door to the world will not stop the evolution of the world. It will not douse but inflame the fears of our citizens\".\nHe added: \"We will not let the rampaging work of extreme nationalism shake a world full of hopes for greater prosperity.\"\nMr Macron said that the US had invented multilateralism and now needed to reinvent it to create a new 21st Century world order.\nHe said the UN and the Nato military alliance might not be able to fulfil their mandates and assure stability if the West ignored the new dangers arising in the world.\nMacron has provided a masterclass to other world leaders on how to handle Donald Trump - you cuddle up close, you flatter where necessary - but you use that to allow you to pack a big punch.\nHe also spoke about the very special relationship between France and the US, a move that might have had some in Downing Street choking on their tea.\nIn a cleverly crafted speech, he started with the entente between himself and the US president that some said was just too cordial. But then came the punches - and they were hard-hitting jabs, taking direct aim at Donald Trump's policy agenda. On free trade, on the importance of science, on inequality - and Mr Trump's America First policies.\nThen he audaciously borrowed Donald Trump's Make America Great Again slogan to talk about the environment, and the importance of the climate change agreement the US has said it will withdraw from. He said it was time to make the Earth great again.\nThe speech was punctuated by applause and cheering. This was an important moment in the US Congress. Emmanuel Macron has emerged as a world leader who offers a competing and sharply different world vision to the US president - while all the time maintaining a bonhomie with him. That's quite a political feat.\nOn trade, Mr Macron said that \"commercial war is not the proper answer\", as it would \"destroy jobs and increase prices\", adding: \"We should negotiate through the World Trade Organization. We wrote these rules, we should follow them.\"\nMr Trump has in the past said that trade wars are good and easily won. He has taken on Europe and China with new tariffs, saying the US has suffered from unfair trade practices. \nOn another issue of difference, Iran, Mr Macron said his country would not abandon a nuclear deal with Tehran that was agreed by world powers when President Barack Obama was in office but which Mr Trump has branded \"terrible\".\nMr Macron said: \"This agreement may not address all concerns, and very important concerns. This is true. But we should not abandon it without having something more substantial instead.\"\nBut he added: \"Iran shall never possess any nuclear weapons. Not now. Not in five years. Not in 10 years. Never.\"\nOn the environment, he said by \"polluting the oceans, not mitigating CO2 emissions and destroying biodiversity we are killing our planet. Let us face it, there is no Planet B\".\nDonald Trump last year announced that he intended to withdraw the US from the Paris global climate accord, another landmark Obama achievement, saying it was a \"very bad deal for the US\".\nThe accord, signed by nearly 200 countries, aims to cut damaging emissions.\nMr Macron's wide-ranging address highlighted numerous political and cultural links, citing American Revolutionary War officer Marquis de Lafayette, writer and feminist Simone de Beauvoir, Abraham Lincoln, author Ernest Hemingway, the founder of French romanticism François-René Chateaubriand and both Presidents Roosevelt.\nHis quoting of Franklin D's \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself\" drew one of his biggest applauses.\nSenior House Democrat Adam Schiff said Mr Macron had offered \"more of a direct contradiction of the president than I was expecting\", telling AFP: \"There were more than a few uncomfortable moments on the [Republican] side of the aisle.\"\nRepublican Senator Jeff Flake said the speech was \"very contrary to Trumpism, very much contrary to an America First agenda\".\nBut Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy denied there was any rebuke.\n\"He said in there that he believes in free and fair trade. That's exactly what the president asked for,\" he said.\n",

            "content": "US President Donald Trump says he is rolling back the Obama administration's \"completely one-sided deal with Cuba\". \nSpeaking in Miami, Florida, he said his new policy would tighten rules affecting travel and on sending funds to the Caribbean island nation.\nBut he is not reversing key diplomatic and commercial ties, and will not close the US embassy in Havana.\nCommercial flights from the US will continue, as will allowing Americans to return home with Cuban goods.\nMr Trump said the Obama administration's March 2016 deal with the \"brutal\" Castro government was \"terrible\" and \"misguided\".\nOn Friday, Mr Trump signed a presidential directive calling for tighter enforcement of a longstanding ban on American tourists going to Cuba.\nThe new policy bans most US business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, a Cuban entity involved in all sectors of the economy.\nHowever, it exempts air and sea travel, allowing US airlines and cruise lines to continue serving the island. \nThis is a rollback, not a reversal, of Obama's Cuba policy. In the main, it is a gift to the old guard Cuban Americans in Miami who opposed the detente and voted for Trump. So it bans financial transactions with the commercial arm of Cuba's military. But it also takes into account pressure from US businesses that don't want to turn the clock back.  \nSo it does not \"disrupt\" existing joint ventures and carves out other exceptions. Probably the most visible effect will be a slowdown of American visitors, who took advantage of looser travel rules that Trump says he'll now strictly enforce. \nThe president framed his policy in the human rights concerns of his Miami constituency, which is passionate about the regime's repression of political freedoms. But critics questioned why he singled out Cuba for such treatment when he's made a point of not lecturing other nations for bad behaviour. \nThey also point out that Havana doesn't respond well to such treatment: - it's made very clear it will not be pressured into making political reforms. \nAnd it won't have taken kindly to Trump's blistering take down of the \"cruel and brutal\" communist regime. Whatever the practical economic consequences of this new/old policy, it seems likely to reinstate the adversarial relationship Obama sought to transform. \nMr Trump had faced calls from the business community not to completely reverse his Democratic predecessor's diplomatic rapprochement between the two former Cold War foes.\nMyron Brilliant of the US Chamber of Commerce said: \"Unfortunately, today's moves actually limit the possibility for positive change on the island and risk ceding growth opportunities to other countries that, frankly, may not share America's interest in a free and democratic Cuba that respects human rights. \"\nZane Kerby of the American Society of Travel Agents said before the speech he was \"disappointed\" at Mr Trump's plans to \"turn back the clock\" in terms of expanded travel and trade between the U.S. and Cuba.\n\"The past few years have seen a growth in business for US travel agencies, tour operators, airlines, cruise lines, hotel and other travel companies. That progress now appears to be at great risk,\" he added.\nGranma, the Cuban government's state-run newspaper, said the president was \"stuck in a failed policy that has caused much damage to the Cuban people and has left the United States isolated\".\nThe Miami speech is the latest part of former President Barack Obama's legacy that Mr Trump has moved to dismantle.\nHe cancelled the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, announced he would withdraw the US from the Paris climate accord, and is attempting to repeal and replace Obamacare, his predecessor's signature policy accomplishment.\nIn Friday's remarks, Mr Trump set out how his administration would seek to prevent US dollars from being used to fund what it regards as a repressive military-dominated government.\n\"The profits from investment and tourism flow directly to the military,\" he said to applause. \"The regime take the money and owns the industry.\"\n\"We do not want US dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba,\" he told the audience.\nEarlier in the day, Vice-President Mike Pence visited Little Havana in Miami to play dominos with Cuban-Americans.\n\"The embargo should continue. Why give credit to a country where the people don´t see a penny? They are still starving and there is no freedom whatsoever. Why should we keep feeding the people who are on top when they repress their own people.\" \n\"I  am 100% Republican. I agree 150% with everything Trump says and does. They should impose more sanctions against Cuba. When Obama made the agreement and restored relations with the Cuban government, he gave them everything they asked for. We received nothing from the Cuban government. This is why Trump wants to strengthen the sanctions.\" \n\"I am against the embargo. The Cuban tyranny uses the embargo as a pretext to justify that it has failed. Everything bad that happens in Cuba, they blame the embargo.\" \n",

I think he is a great guy and was a very charismatic leader.\"\nJody Mulvey, 20, from Edinburgh said: \"I'm disappointed we didn't get to see Obama but I understand after everything that's going on right now.\" \nThe dinner at the EICC is thought to be one of his first major addresses since his term as president came to an end.\nTickets for a table of 10 at the event are understood to have cost about £5,000.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon was at the dinner.\nAlthough the media were not allowed inside, Mr Obama is reported to have said that in times of inequality people turn to simplistic and populist answers on the left and the right.\nHe also spoke about the Manchester bombing, saying it is not possible to solve lone wolf attacks perfectly. \nIf someone is determined and willing to die, he said, it is almost impossible to prevent that entirely.\nAll of the cash raised at the dinner will be split between children's charities in Scotland and the Obama Foundation.\nSecurity was tight in Edinburgh as police stepped up resources around major events in the wake of the Manchester bombing.\nThirteen-year-old Mila Stricevic, from Glasgow, read a poem after winning a schools competition.\nMr Obama, a golfing enthusiast, had been joined in St Andrews by Sir Tom Hunter, whose charitable foundation had invited Obama to speak in Edinburgh.\nAfter completing the third hole, Mr Obama spoke to the crowd who had been following him around the course.\nHe shook hands with people and asked them how they were doing before heading back to play golf.\nThe Hunter Foundation has previously arranged for US politicians and actors including Bill Clinton, Leonardo DiCaprio and \nLast year, \nAnnouncing Barack Obama's visit in April, Sir Tom said: \"From the south side of Chicago to the White House has been an epic, historic journey and it will be a true honour to hear that story from the man who made that journey.\n\"We are both truly proud and delighted to be hosting the 44th president of the United States in Scotland at this event.\"\n",

            "content": "Michelle Obama has launched a fierce defence of the healthy eating initiatives she championed as first lady.\nAt a public health summit in Washington, she hit back after the Trump administration loosened nutritional standards aimed at making US school lunches healthier.\n\"Think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap,\" she said.\nOne in five American children is obese, government figures show.\nIn thinly-veiled criticism of the policies of the new administration, Mrs Obama told the audience: \"This is where you really have to look at motives, you know. \n\"You have to stop and think, why don't you want our kids to have good food at school? What is wrong with you? And why is that a partisan issue? Why would that be political? What is going on?\"\nShe added: \"Take me out of the equation - like me or don't like me. But think about why someone is OK with your kids eating crap. \n\"Why would you celebrate that? Why would you sit idly and be okay with that? Because here's the secret: If someone is doing that, they don't care about your kid.\"\nWhile in the White House, Mrs Obama championed the \"Let's Move\" campaign, which encourages exercise and healthy eating among young people.\nThe 2010 Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act made federal grants for school meals conditional on reductions in calories, sodium and trans fat content and increases in fruit, vegetables and whole grains.\nHowever, earlier this month, \nHe said some aspects of the standards had \"gone too far\".\nThe agriculture department said the change would give schools \"greater flexibility\".\n",
